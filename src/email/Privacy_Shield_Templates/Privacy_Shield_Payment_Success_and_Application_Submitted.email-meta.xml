    <textOnly>Dear {!Payment__c.OwnerFirstName} {!Payment__c.OwnerLastName},

Thank you for your organization’s interest in self-certifying its adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles. The Privacy Shield team at the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration (ITA) has received your organization’s self-certification application, as well as payment of the processing fee, and will review your organization’s self-certification application in a timely manner. 

Please note that the processing time will depend on the completeness of the self-certification application and the volume of self-certification applications received. Please note as well that we are currently experiencing an unusually high volume of applications and thus would appreciate your cooperation and patience.

As the designated representative of your organization, you will be notified by e-mail regarding the status of the self-certification. You will receive either:

Confirmation that your organization’s self-certification has been finalized; or
A request for additional information to complete the review of your organization’s self-certification application or revisions to materials relevant to the self-certification, such as the applicable privacy policy statement(s).

When an organization’s self-certification has been finalized, the organization is placed on the authoritative Privacy Shield List maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Privacy Shield List is made available to the public on the Privacy Shield website: https://www.privacyshield.gov/. Privacy Shield benefits are assured from the date that the Department places an organization on the Privacy Shield List.

Privacy Shield organizations that utilize the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) as an independent recourse mechanism for personal data transferred from the EU are required to pay an annual fee of US $50 in order to cover the operating costs of the panel established by the EU DPAs. This fee is payable to the United States Council for International Business (USCIB), which has agreed to act as a trusted third party for this purpose. If your organization does utilize the EU DPAs in this capacity, please visit USCIB’s website at http://www.uscib.org/privacy-shield/ to pay this fee and provide the Privacy Shield team with a copy of the receipt confirming payment.

In Annex I, the Department of Commerce committed to facilitating the establishment of a fund into which Privacy Shield organizations will be required to pay contributions to cover the arbitral costs, including arbitrator fees, up to maximum amounts, in consultation with the European Commission. The International Centre for Dispute Resolution-American Arbitration Association (ICDR-AAA) was selected to administer these arbitrations and manage this fund. The arbitration mechanism described in Annex I and required contributions are separate from an organization’s obligation to provide an independent recourse mechanism. Each organization self-certifying to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield must make the required contribution: organizations self-certifying to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield for the first time will be required to pay the contribution before the ITA will finalize their initial self-certification; and existing participants in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program that have not already paid the contribution will be required to pay the contribution before the ITA will finalize their re-certification. Please visit ICDR-AAA’s website at http://go.adr.org/privacyshieldfund.html to pay this fee.

Thank you for your cooperation.</textOnly>
