    <textOnly>As of {!Asset.UsageEndDate} your organization, {!Asset.Account}, is listed on the Privacy Shield program’s Inactive List: https://www.privacyshield.gov/inactive.

You are receiving this email because your organization has failed to complete its annual re-certification to the Department of Commerce regarding participation in the Privacy Shield program.  As a result, the Department will remove your organization from the Privacy Shield List, meaning that your organization may no longer benefit from the European Commission’s adequacy decision to receive personal information from the EU and/or the Swiss Government’s adequacy decision to receive personal information from Switzerland.

Your organization must remove from any relevant privacy policy any references to Privacy Shield that imply that the organization continues to actively participate in Privacy Shield and is entitled to its benefits.

Your organization must verify whether it will return, delete, or continue to apply the Privacy Shield Principles to the personal information that it received in reliance upon Privacy Shield, and if personal information will be retained, verify who within the organization will serve as an ongoing point of contact for Privacy Shield-related questions.

Your organization must complete and submit the “Failure to Recertify Questionnaire” to privacyshield@trade.gov  as an e-mail attachment.  A copy of the questionnaire is available on the Privacy Shield website at: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=Administration-of-Privacy-Shield.

Failure to respond to this request within 30 days may be subject to enforcement action by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Transportation, or other enforcement authorities.

If you have any questions, please contact the Privacy Shield Team via our website assistance page: https://www.privacyshield.gov/assistance.

Thank you for your cooperation.</textOnly>
