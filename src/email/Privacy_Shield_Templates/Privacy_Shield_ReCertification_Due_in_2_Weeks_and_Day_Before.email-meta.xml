    <textOnly>PRIVACY SHIELD RE-CERTIFICATION FOLLOW-UP REMINDER


**If you have already submitted your annual re-certification, please disregard this email**


Our records indicate that the original Privacy Shield self-certification for {!Asset.Account} was finalized on {!Asset.InstallDate}. Your organization must recertify or withdraw from the Privacy Shield by {!Asset.UsageEndDate}.

The U.S. Department of Commerceâ€™s International Trade Administration (ITA) invites your organization to re-certify its adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles, including the Supplemental Principles or confirm that your organization wishes to withdraw from the Privacy Shield program.

If your organization does not withdraw from the program, but nevertheless fails to complete the annual re-certification process in a timely manner, its self-certification will lapse, it will be removed from the Privacy Shield Active List, and it will no longer be assured of the benefits of the Privacy Shield.

Please see the previous Privacy Shield Re-Certification Reminder, detailing the recertification process, or find more information here: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=Administration-of-Privacy-Shield.

If your organization has any questions concerning the re-certification process, please the Privacy Shield Team here: https://www.privacyshield.gov/assistance.</textOnly>
